Gosh, there are so many forks in the road, so many times in my life where I have felt uncertain whether it was just entering adulthood, coming out of college and not knowing what to do with my life, or at midlife. You know, after I had a family and a husband and children and really wasn't sure what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. So whether you're dealing with decisions around your career or relationships or anything else, something I've always turned to as an adult is therapy. Therapy helps you stay connected to what you really want while you navigate life. Trusting yourself to make decisions that align with your values is like anything. The more you practice it, the easier it gets. I have found it's exactly the kind of thing that a good therapist can help with. If you're thinking of starting therapy, you can give better help a try. It's entirely online and it's designed to be convenient, flexible and suited to your schedule because we know we all have crazy busy schedules these days. Let therapy be your map with better help.

Here's bubbling. What is actual now enables what is next possible, the adjacent possible. The bias has been bubbling forth for four billion years, creating new possibilities in the universe. And that bubbling is critical that physics cannot talk at all about bubbling new bubbles. Life on Earth started four billion years ago. It is for the first two and a half billion years with single cell organisms co-evolving, even by existing organisms create new possibilities. If I'm a bacterium and you're a bacterium and I have a flat surface, I'm a possible highway you can walk over to get food. That's bubbling forth. So two and a half billion years after life started, six times multi cell organisms emerged. A billion years after that, three and a half billions after life started is the extraordinary Cambrian explosion. Five hundred and forty million years ago for fifty million years, there was just this burst of creativity making all of the phyla that exists now in order to talk about how the biosphere has been created. I have to talk about the functions of parts of an organ. You all know your heart keeps you alive, but in particular, your heart pumps blood. It's not by making heart sounds. So this means something fundamental. The function of a part is that subset of its causal properties that sustain the whole, your heart pumping blood and you. But doing that is jury rigging, finding subsets of causal features of use. Some years ago, my daughter dropped her purse in a shallow well. I took a wire coat hanger, slid it over a mop handle and I fished out her purse. Anything can be used for more than one thing. For example, a screwdriver can be used to screw in a screw, but it's great for scraping putty off the wall. An engine block and have eight holes drilled and you make an engine out of it. It's actually a superb paperweight and much research done only by scientists demonstrates that the corners are sharp and can crack open a coconut. I was very proud of that. So, but if you're using an engine block as a paperweight, can you deduce? Oh, I can use this thing to crack open coconuts. You can't. It might be a banana peel, but that means also something fundamental. Finding new uses for things. Jury rigging is not a computation. It's not a deduction. Jury rigging is not a computation at all. Computers are. The biosphere is forever innovating in this kind of way that's not a deduction. For example, there are things called Darwinian pre-adaptations. Dinosaurs had scales that were evolved from thermoregulation that were jury rigged into flight feathers. Your eyes have clear crystallines that were evolved from thermoregulation that were jury rigged into flight feathers. Your eyes have clear crystallines that were perfectly normal colored enzymes. And this too means something fundamental. We cannot deduce what is in the adjacent possible that the evolving biosphere will create then become. We do not even know what can happen. In fact, we can use no mathematics based on set theory, which is all of mathematics, to deduce what the biosphere is going to become or the economy. This means we are at a fantastic third train phase transition in science. We're beyond Newton. We're beyond quantum mechanics. We're beyond the exquisite view that Copernicus had 480 years ago that the world is a clockwork. The biosphere is not a clockwork. The paper that just published it came out three days ago. I'm pretty proud of it. It's actually worth reading. We can't deduce what is in the biosphere and will become, but we can make a mathematical theory of the statistics of the process. I call it the theory of the adjacent possible or TAP. It's really based on one idea. Things can be combined to make new things. So there's the equation. MT is the number of things in the economy at some time now. Say 10 things. So how many things will be in the economy in the next period? Well, if the 10 things work, we'll keep them. But we could actually try to jury rig something new out of any single thing among the 10 or out of pair of things among the 10. The printing press is a recombination between movable type and a wine press or any three things or four things. If there's 100 things, those 4500 things we might jury rig with. And if there's 1000 things, there's a half a million things we might fiddle with. Therefore, this process, the TAP process has the property that for a long time, the number of things increases very, very, very slowly. Then something stunning happens. There's a hockey stick explosion and the number of things reaches infinity in a finite time. There's a singularity and a brief burst explosion for 40 million years of the Cambrian explosion. The same pattern is showing up in our own evolution. Australopithecus flourished in Africa 3.3 million years ago. A million and a half years later, Homo erectus had about 20 crude stone tools. A mere 30,000 years ago, Chromagnon in the south of France had about 100 or 150 of these exquisite pressure flake tools. A mere 28,000 years after that is Mesopotamia with needles and chariots. There's something interesting about the fact, of course, we invented writing, which is a wonderful story. Once you have a clay tablet, it calls forth the tool that's its complement. You need a stylus. So tools make niches for new tools and for new jobs. Scribes earned a living for quite a while. And this is just now. We have billions of tools ranging from knitting needles to the space station. And the thing is, there's always an adjacent possible. Once you've made a bow, a crossbow is in the adjacent possible. The pattern that we saw in the Cambrian of a long period, nothing happening and then a burst, is here right now. Nothing happened for 290,000 years, then it burst upward. The same thing is true of GDP. GDP was flat since the time of Christ. In fact, for the last 100,000 years, GDP burst up in the last two centuries. It's going up vertically now. It's wonderful. We're lifting millions from poverty. And the theory explains it. It's the same delay and burst. And there it is. We start making more complex things, selling them, and we make a profit. There's another feature of all of this. I've lived in my lifetime. I'm 83. I was born in 1939. Just like the Cambrian explosion, I've watched the number of things that have come into existence in my lifetime. We didn't have any helicopters. We didn't have television. I listened to the Lone Ranger, which maybe you know, on radio, 6 o'clock at night. We didn't have computers. We didn't have plastics, which are now all over the planet. We didn't have microwaves. We didn't have lasers. Look at the number of things that came into existence in one lifetime of 83 years. Not much happened 50,000 years ago in 83 years. So what's going on? The TAP process has the following property. Every time you make something new, the waiting time for the next new thing is cut in half. A thousand years, 500 years, 250. A year, six months, three months. We're going to get a great acceleration. We are. So we need to find a better adjacent possible. We're rampaging over the planet. And the hope is in soils. So I'm going to talk briefly about compost. There are very fine composts. This is not terribly important. A very good compost is the Johnson-Sue compost. Less land use. Fewer degradations of our forests. Fewer extinction events. Fewer pandemics. Well, let's get rid of fertilizer. And the most important point I'm going to take is... This is really bad news and good news. Last year we emitted 40.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide. We have to find a way of solving it and we can. We can take this Johnson-Sue compost and get it out across the landscape. But more fundamentally, we can find good fungal bacterial communities. And we can coat seeds with it and sell the seeds around the planet. Or we can fill biochar and we can use biochar to get it across the planet. Most useful, we can take a really good fungal bacterial community, put it into biochar, some other matrix, mix it into fertilizer, and get that fertilizer out across the planet. I'm going to just end with the following. Fungal bacterial communities are precisely something that can create novel adjacent possibles. They can bubble forth with solutions to soil problems. The good news is we can do it now. The planet's on fire. We are of nature, ladies and gentlemen. We're not above nature. Thank you.\""]},"execution_count":13,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["podcast_transcript_1 =

Gosh, there are so many \n","forks in the road, so many times in my life where I have felt uncertain whether \n","it was just entering adulthood, coming out of college and not knowing what to do\n","with my life, or at midlife, you know, after I had a family and a husband and \n","children and really wasn't sure what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. So\n","whether you're dealing with decisions around your career or relationships or \n","anything else, something I've always turned to as an adult is therapy. Therapy \n","helps you stay connected to what you really want while you navigate life. \n","Trusting yourself to make decisions that align with your values is like \n","anything. The more you practice it, the easier it gets. I have found it's \n","exactly the kind of thing that a good therapist can help with. If you're \n","thinking of starting therapy, you can give better help a try. It's entirely \n","online and it's designed to be convenient, flexible and suited to your schedule \n","because we know we all have crazy busy schedules these days.

Twenty five \n","hundred years ago, Heraclitus said, the world bubbles forth. For four billion \n","years bubbling, what is actual now enables what is next possible, the adjacent \n","possible. The biazer has been bubbling forth for four billion years, creating \n","new possibilities in the universe and that bubbling. It's critical that physics \n","cannot talk at all about bubbling new bubbles. Life on Earth started four \n","billion years ago. Two and a half billion years with single cell organisms \n","co-evolving. Even my existing organisms create new possibilities. If I'm a \n","bacterium and you're a bacterium and I have a flat surface, I'm a possible \n","highway you can walk over to get food. That's bubbling forth. So two and a half \n","billion years after life started, six times multicell organisms emerged. A \n","billion years after that, three and a half billions after life started is the \n","extraordinary Cambrian explosion. Five hundred and forty million years ago, for \n","fifty million years, there was just this burst of creativity making all of the \n","phyla that exists now. In order to talk about how the biazer has been created, I\n","have to talk about the functions of parts of an organ. You all know your heart \n","keeps you alive, but in particular your heart pumps blood. It's not by making \n","heart sounds. So this means something fundamental. The function of a part is \n","that subset of its causal properties that sustain the whole. Your heart pumping \n","blood in you. But doing that is jury-rigging, finding subsets of causal features\n","of use. Some years ago, my daughter dropped her purse in a shallow well. I took \n","a wire coat hanger, slid it over a mop handle, and I fished out her purse. \n","Anything can be used for more than one thing. For example, a screwdriver can be \n","used to screw in a screw, but it's great for scraping putty off the wall. An \n","engine block can have eight holes drilled and you make an engine out of it. It's\n","actually a superb paperweight. And much research done only by scientists \n","demonstrates that the corners are sharp and can crack open a coconut. I was very\n","proud of that. But if you're using an engine block as a paperweight, can you \n","deduce, oh, I can use this thing to crack open coconuts? You can't. It might be \n","a banana peel. But that means also something fundamental, finding new uses for \n","things, jury-rigging, is not a computation. It's not a deduction. Jury-rigging \n","is not a computation at all. Computers are. The biosphere is forever innovating \n","in this kind of way that's not a deduction. For example, there are things called\n","Darwinian pre-adaptations. Dinosaurs had scales that were evolved from \n","thermoregulation that were jury-rigged into flight feathers. Your eyes have \n","clear crystallines that were perfectly normal colored enzymes. And this too \n","means something fundamental. We cannot deduce what is in the adjacent possible \n","that the evolving biosphere will create, then become. We do not even know what \n","can happen. In fact, we can use no mathematics based on set theory, which is all\n","of mathematics, to deduce what the biosphere is going to become or the economy. \n","This means we are at a fantastic third phase transition in science. We're beyond\n","Newton. We're beyond quantum mechanics. We're beyond the exquisite view that \n","Copernicus had 480 years ago that the world is a clockwork. The biosphere is not\n","a clockwork. The paper that just published it came out three days ago. I'm \n","pretty proud of it. It's actually worth reading. We can't deduce what is in the \n","biosphere and will become, but we can make a mathematical theory of the \n","statistics of the process. I call it the theory of the adjacent possible or TAP.\n","It's really based on one idea. Things can be combined to make new things. So \n","there's the equation. MT is the number of things in the economy at some time \n","now. Say 10 things. So how many things will be in the economy in the next \n","period? Well, if the 10 things work, we'll keep them. But we could actually try \n","to jury rig something new out of any single thing among the 10 or out of pair of\n","things that are in the economy. So if we have a pair of things among the 10, the\n","printing press is a recombination between movable type and a wine press, or any \n","three things or four things. If there's 100 things, those 4,500 things we might \n","jury rig with. And if there's 1,000 things, there's a half a million things we \n","might fiddle with. Therefore, this process, the TAP process, has the property \n","that for a long time the number of things increases very, very, very slowly, \n","then something stunning happens. There's a hockey stick explosion, and the \n","number of things reaches infinity in a finite time. There's a singularity and a \n","brief burst explosion for 40 million years of the Cambrian explosion. The same \n","pattern is showing up in our own evolution. Australopithecus flourished in \n","Africa 3.3 million years ago. A million and a half years later, Homo erectus had\n","about 20 crude stone tools. A mere 30,000 years ago, Chromagnon in the south of \n","France had about 100 or 150 of these exquisite pressure flake tools. A mere \n","28,000 years after that is Mesopotamia with needles and chariots. There's \n","something interesting about the fact, of course we invented writing, which is a \n","wonderful story. Once you have a clay tablet, it calls forth the tool that's its\n","complement. You need a stylus. So tools make niches for new tools and for new \n","jobs. Scribes turned to living for quite a while. And this is just now. We have \n","billions of tools ranging from knitting needles to the space station. There's \n","always an adjacent possible. Once you've made a bow, a crossbow is in the \n","adjacent possible. The pattern that we saw in the Cambrian of a long period, \n","nothing happening and then a burst, is here right now. Nothing happened for \n","290,000 years, then it burst upward. The same thing is true of GDP. GDP was flat\n","since the time of Christ. In fact, for the last 100,000 years, GDP burst up in \n","the last two centuries. It's going up vertically now. It's wonderful. We're \n","lifting millions from poverty. And the theory explains it. It's the same delay \n","and burst. And there it is. We start making more complex things, selling them, \n","and we make a profit. There's another feature of all of this. I lived in my \n","lifetime. I'm 83. I was born in 1939. Just like the Cambrian explosion, watch \n","the number of things that have come into existence in my lifetime. We didn't \n","have any helicopters. We didn't have television. I listened to the Lone Ranger, \n","which maybe you know. On radio, 6 o'clock at night, we didn't have computers. We\n","didn't have plastics, which are now all over the planet. We didn't have \n","microwaves. We didn't have lasers. Look at the number of things that came into \n","existence in one lifetime of 83 years. Not much happened 50,000 years ago in 83 \n","years. So what's going on? The TAP process has the following property. Every \n","time you make something new, the waiting time for the next new thing is cut in \n","half. 1,000 years, 500 years, 250. A year, six months, three months. We're going\n","to get a great acceleration. We are. So we need to find a better adjacent \n","possible. We're rampaging over the planet, and the hope is in soils. So I'm \n","going to talk briefly about compost. There are very fine composts. This is not \n","terribly important. A very good compost is the Johnson Sue compost. Less land \n","use, fewer degradations of our forests, fewer extinction events, fewer \n","pandemics. Well, let's get rid of fertilizer. And the most important point I'm \n","going to take is this is really bad news and good news. Last year we emitted \n","40.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide. We have to find a way of solving it, and we\n","can. We can take this Johnson Sue compost and get it out across the landscape. \n","But more fundamentally, we can find good fungal bacterial communities, and we \n","can coat seeds with it and sell the seeds around the planet. Or we can fill \n","biochar, and we can use biochar to get it across the planet. Most usefully, we \n","can take a really good fungal bacterial community, put it into biochar, some \n","other matrix, mix it into fertilizer, and get that fertilizer out across the \n","planet. I'm going to just end with the following. Fungal bacterial communities \n","are precisely something that can create novel adjacent possibles, that can \n","bubble forth with solutions to soil problems. The good news is we can do it now.\n","The planet's on fire. We are of nature, ladies and gentlemen. We're not above \n","nature. Thank you.

innovating and creating new possibilities for billions \n","of years.\n","- The process of finding new uses for things is not a deduction, but a form of \n","jury rigging and innovation.\n","- We are at a third phase transition in science, beyond Newton and quantum \n","mechanics.\n","- The theory of the adjacent possible (TAP) states that things can be combined \n","to make new things.\n","- The number of things in the economy increases slowly, then experiences a burst\n","of exponential growth.\n","- This burst of growth has been observed in the Cambrian explosion, our own \n","evolution, and in GDP.\n","- Every time something new is created, the waiting time for the next new thing \n","is cut in half.\n","- We need to find a better adjacent possible to address global challenges like \n","climate change and soil degradation.\n","- Compost, specifically the Johnson Sue compost, holds potential solutions to \n","these challenges.\n","- By promoting good fungal bacterial communities, coating seeds with them, and \n","using biochar, we can enhance soil health and address climate issues.\n","\u001b[34m⠧\u001b[0m \u001b[34mRunning (1/1 containers active)...\u001b[0m \u001b[37mView
